# mniProject-TicToeToe-
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The CSS provides a visually appealing design:
      The game board is centered with flexbox, and each box has a clean, rounded appearance with a glowing effect.
      Colors are chosen for a dark background with light, contrasting elements, enhancing visibility.
      Buttons for resetting and starting a new game are styled with hover-friendly designs.
JavaScript Functionality 
    The script manages game logic:
      Game Turns: Players alternate between "X" and "O".
      Win Detection: Checks all winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals) using a predefined array.
      Game State Management:
          Disables boxes after selection.
          Displays a winner message in a modal-like container when a player wins.
          Resets the game board for a new round.
